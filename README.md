# Implement both Prim's and Kruskal's greedy algorithms for finding a minimum-spanning tree in a weighted undirected graph.

- Refamiliarize yourself with induction
- Figure out Prim's
- Implement Prim's
- refamiliarize yourself with Kruskal's
- implement Kruskal's
- design an adjacency list using an object in 
- produce graphs of different sizes
    -different number of cities
    - different number of paths 
    - different number of lengths (is this significant)
- prims': random vertex selection
- figure out where in prims do we design a recursive(or iterative implemenation?)
